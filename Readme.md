# Slate Configuration File

This is a `.slate.js` file for the [Slate Window Management System](https://github.com/mattr-/slate).

> Slate is a window management application similar to Divvy and SizeUp (except better and free!). Originally written to replace them due to some limitations in how each work, it attempts to overcome them by simply being extremely configurable. As a result, it may be a bit daunting to get configured, but once it is done, the benefit is huge.

The layout is based on a windows only application "WinSplit Revolution".  For a quick overview [watch this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1AtHyf4pRQ).

I switch from a desktop full keyboard to a laptop so this includes two sets of keyboard bindings. 

Keyboard shortcuts for a full keyboard can be access via. <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>number pad #</kbd>.

Keyboard shortcuts for a smaller keyboard (without number pad) can be access via. <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>option</kbd>+<kbd>arrow key</kbd> and <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>option</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>arrow key</kbd>.

## Install
See [mattr-/slate#installing-slate](https://github.com/mattr-/slate#installing-slate) for Slate install instructions.  Then run this command in your terminal:

~~~bash
cd ~ && curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/josephlavin/slate-config/master/slate.js -o .slate.js
~~~

This will put [slate.js](slate.js) into your `home` directory as `.slate.js`.
